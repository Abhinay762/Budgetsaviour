                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Jeevan Saral offers flexibility, life cover, guaranteed returns, and loyalty additions. You get death benefits during the term, maturity sum assured at the end, and potential annual bonuses and tax exemptions under Section 80C and 10(10D).

                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What drawbacks does Jeevan Saral have?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Because of changes in regulations, the plan was no longer available for new purchasers. Additionally, it may provide lesser returns than more recent investment-linked schemes and lacks clarity in bonus and loyalty addition disclosures.
                </p>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What financial advantages can Jeevan Saral offer?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  With-profits entitles you to a portion of LIC's excess. Annual bonuses and potential loyalty enhancements are given to Jeevan Saral policyholders, gradually raising the maturity and death benefit amounts.
                </p>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Does a Jeevan-Saral policy allow us to borrow money?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Yes, after paying premiums for at least three years, you are eligible to take out a policy loan. Interest is due at the current rates set by LIC, and the loan amount is often between 85 and 90 percent of the surrender value.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How is the maturity amount of Jeevan Saral calculated?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  To determine your maturity value, use our free online Jeevan Saral 165 maturity calculator. It takes into account the policy duration, sum assured, bonus, age at entry, premium paid, and loyalty additions.

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Is it okay to take a loan from a LIC policy?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Lower interest rates and ease of use characterise loans secured by LIC policies. If you require short-term funding that won't impact your credit score, this is an excellent choice. On the other hand, the maturity or death benefit is diminished by unpaid debts.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Is it still possible to get LIC Jeevan Saral?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Jeevan Saral is no longer available to new clients of LIC. If you currently have a policy, though, it is still in effect and offers all of its benefits, such as incentives and maturity payouts.
                </p>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Does the calculator have perfect accuracy?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Using assumptions and current LIC rates, <a href="/" className="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800">our calculator</a> provides you with an estimate that is almost correct. Final maturity values, however, are contingent to the bonuses and loyalty additions announced by LIC at the time of payout.
                </p>
              </div>


              <div>
                <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How much is the loyalty addition?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  LIC announces loyalty additions based on the fund's performance and policy term. They can greatly increase your returns and are usually included for plans held for more than ten years.
